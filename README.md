# Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of learning projects completed as part of Codecademy and Scrimba.com courses, primarily focusing on TypeScript and React.

## Structure

The projects are organized into subdirectories, reflecting the different technologies and courses:

- [js/](./js/README.md): Contains JavaScript related projects.
  * [js/ts/](./js/ts/README.md): Contains TypeScript specific projects from Codecademy.
  * [js/react/](./js/react/README.md): Intended for Skrimba React projects (currently under development).

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to showcase the practical application of concepts learned during the courses and to serve as a personal stockpile of coding exercises and small projects.
